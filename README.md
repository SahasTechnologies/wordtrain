# WordTrain

This website helps you to build your vocabulary by playing a simple word game with bots or other players.
Access it through [Wordtrain](https://wordtrain.sahas.dpdns.org)

### Rules
- Each word must start with the last letter of the word before it, e.g:
```
Cat -> Tail -> List
```
- The words do not have to be related to each other in any way, they just need to be a word in one of these 3 websites:
[Free Dictionary API](https://freedictionaryapi.com)
[Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev)
[Wikitionary](https://en.wiktionary.org)

The dictionary for bots is found through [Random Word API](random-word-api.herokuapp.com) since it can provide a whole list of words that the bots can select from.
